## My process

For my process I was teasked to use React and Tawilwindcss. For the carousel I used a node package called Swiperjs. This is a fully customisable carousel package that can be instantly added to any React project easily. The Test also included a mobile first approach. I also used .map() to filter through an object of the images and their respective alt's and classes.

### Built with

- React
- Tailwindcss
- SVG's
- Mobile-first workflow
- SwiperJs
- Javascript

### What I learned

It was my first time using Tailwindcss and it was a very interesting process. Mixing it with React seemed a bit confusing at first but with a steady workflow I was soon able to achieve as close to the results I desired. The documentation is very easy to follow and there are numerous videos for more in depth know how.

### Continued development

It would certainly be a good weapon in my arsenal to use Tailwind. I would like to use more features for animations and UI interactivity.

### Useful resources

- [Getting started with Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Documents are the first place I look when I would like to use a new framework.
- [Make a React Website with Tailwind CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOQ31Kc8H5E&t=1102s) - I used this video by Brian Design to help me get the basics of how to implement Tailwind with React.
